# My Documentation

i made this because i want a simple documentation template
not a generator, but maybe not just markdown->html, but i made several markdown, and also have some in html.

so for that, i make this little project. you can use it too :-)

### filesGenerate
in sidebar, the list of files served from files/repo.json,
that file made from filesGenerate.php / filesGenerate.js

after create new file/folder in files directory just run the filesGenerate again, example:
in php
```
php filesGenerate.php
```

in javascript/node
```
node filesGenerate.js
```

or you can click "reload" menu in up right, if you run this in "apache+php" environment

### DEVELOPMENT

for development, you can start to create new directory in "files" directory.
and add some md files (exp: hello.md), then run fileGenerate / click reload

for now its support md, html, and img.. but if you get the idea and you can costumize this project, 
just make your own version :-)
